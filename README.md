Welcome to my repository documenting my journey into the world of deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras. This repository will include my notes, code snippets, projects, and resources as I progress from a beginner to a more advanced level in deep learning.

Contents
Notes: Detailed explanations and summaries of key concepts in deep learning.
Code Snippets: Reusable code snippets for common deep learning tasks.
Projects: End-to-end projects demonstrating the application of TensorFlow and Keras.
